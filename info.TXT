In this project, work is done with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like:

    population - The population as of 2015.
    population_growth - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
    area - The total land and water area.


Pandas and matplotlib is used to display results neatly and visualize them because they let us focus on practicing thinking and working in SQL.

Some other GUI based SQL tools which can also be used are 

    1. Mode Analytics
    2. Periscope Data
    3. MySQL Workbench
    4. Jack DB
